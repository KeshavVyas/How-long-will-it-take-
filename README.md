-HelloWorld 2021 Project Submission 
Hello this project was designed to be a tool to help students crowd source and manage their time better. Due to us not being familiar with APIs entirely, we had to make our own mock "Brightspace" or course campus equivalent. Included here are the links to the form where data can be inputted via a google form, a sheet that stores the values. Additionally, the file called AppScript.txt contains the actual javascript we run. At the moment so that the judges may look at our work, most privacy settings have been dropped.

Form to input: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdrRupTwsYR4BD27-a_cz3tcGELG9w6EyWfIgf3EEbec2h-4g/viewform
